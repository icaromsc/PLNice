A novel partial sequence alignment tool for finding large deletions.

Finding large deletions in genome sequences has become increasingly more useful
in bioinformatics, such as in clinical research and diagnosis. Although there are
a number of publically available next generation sequencing mapping and sequence 
alignment programs, these software packages do not correctly align fragments
containing deletions larger than one kb. We present a fast alignment software
package, BinaryPartialAlign, that can be used by wet lab scientists to find long 
structural variations in their experiments. For BinaryPartialAlign, we make use
of the Smith-Waterman (SW) algorithm with a binary-search-based approach for
alignment with large gaps that we called partial alignment. BinaryPartialAlign
implementation is compared with other straight-forward applications of SW.
Simulation results on mtDNA fragments demonstrate the effectiveness (runtime and 
accuracy) of the proposed method.
