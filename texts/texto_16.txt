A novel partial sequenc align tool for find larg delet . Find larg delet in genom sequenc ha becom increasingli more use in bioinformat , such as in clinic research and diagnosi . Although there are a number of public avail next gener sequenc map and sequenc align program , these softwar packag do not correctli align fragment contain delet larger than one kb . We present a fast align softwar packag , BinaryPartialAlign , that can be use by wet lab scientist to find long structur variat in their experi . For BinaryPartialAlign , we make use of the Smith - Waterman ( SW ) algorithm with a binari - search - base approach for align with larg gap that we call partial align . BinaryPartialAlign implement is compar with other straight - forward applic of SW . Simul result on mtDNA fragment demonstr the effect ( runtim and accuraci ) of the propos method .
