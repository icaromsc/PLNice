A knowledg - base multipl - sequenc align algorithm .
A common and cost - effect mechan to identifi the function , structur , or relationship between speci is multipl
- sequenc align , in which DNA / RNA / protein sequenc are arrang and align so that similar between sequenc are cluster togeth .
Correctli identifi and align these sequenc biolog similar help from unwind the mysteri of speci evolut to drug design .
We present our knowledg - base multipl sequenc align ( KB - MSA ) techniqu that util the exist knowledg databas such as SWISSPROT ,
GENBANK , or HOMSTRAD to provid a more realist and reliabl sequenc align .
We also provid a modifi version of thi algorithm ( CB - MSA ) that util the sequenc consist inform when sequenc knowledg databas are not avail .
Our benchmark test on BAliBAS , PREFAB , HOMSTRAD , and SABMARK refer show accuraci improv up to 10 percent on twilight data set against mani lead align tool such as ISPALIGN , PADT , CLUSTALW , MAFFT , PROBCON , and T - COFFE .
