MSuPDA : A Memori Effici Algorithm for Sequenc Align . Space complex is a million dollar question in DNA sequenc align . In thi regard , memori save under pushdown automata can help to reduc the occupi space in comput memori . Our propos process is that anchor seed ( AS ) will be select from given data set of nucleotid base pair for local sequenc align . Quick split techniqu will separ the AS from all the DNA genom segment . Select AS will be place to pushdown automata ' s ( PDA ) input unit . Whole DNA genom segment will be place into PDA ' s stack . AS from input unit will be match with the DNA genom segment from stack of PDA . Match , mismatch and indel of nucleotid will be pop from the stack under the control unit of pushdown automata . Dure the POP oper on stack , it will free the memori cell occupi by the nucleotid base pair .
