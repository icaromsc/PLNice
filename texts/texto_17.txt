MSuPDA: A Memory Efficient Algorithm for Sequence Alignment.

Space complexity is a million dollar question in DNA sequence alignments. In this
regard, memory saving under pushdown automata can help to reduce the occupied
spaces in computer memory. Our proposed process is that anchor seed (AS) will be 
selected from given data set of nucleotide base pairs for local sequence
alignment. Quick splitting techniques will separate the AS from all the DNA
genome segments. Selected AS will be placed to pushdown automata's (PDA) input
unit. Whole DNA genome segments will be placed into PDA's stack. AS from input
unit will be matched with the DNA genome segments from stack of PDA. Match,
mismatch and indel of nucleotides will be popped from the stack under the control
unit of pushdown automata. During the POP operation on stack, it will free the
memory cell occupied by the nucleotide base pair.
