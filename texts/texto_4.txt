PASTA: Ultra-Large Multiple Sequence Alignment for Nucleotide and Amino-Acid Sequences.

We introduce PASTA, a new multiple sequence alignment algorithm. PASTA uses a new
technique to produce an alignment given a guide tree that enables it to be both
highly scalable and very accurate. We present a study on biological and simulated
data with up to 200,000 sequences, showing that PASTA produces highly accurate
alignments, improving on the accuracy and scalability of the leading alignment
methods (including SATé). We also show that trees estimated on PASTA alignments
are highly accurate--slightly better than SATé trees, but with substantial
improvements relative to other methods. Finally, PASTA is faster than SATé,
highly parallelizable, and requires relatively little memory.
