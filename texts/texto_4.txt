PASTA : Ultra - Larg Multipl Sequenc Align for Nucleotid and Amino - Acid Sequenc .
We introduc PASTA , a new multipl sequenc align algorithm .
PASTA use a new techniqu to produc an align given a guid tree that enabl it to be both highli scalabl and veri accur .
We present a studi on biolog and simul data with up to 200 , 000 sequenc , show that PASTA produc highli accur align , improv on the accuraci and scalabl of the lead align method ( includ SATA ).
We also show that tree estim on PASTA align are highli accur -- slightli better than SATA tree , but with substanti improv rel to other method .
Final , PASTA is faster than SATA , highli paralleliz , and requir rel littl memori .
