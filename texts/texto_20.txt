Efficient and Accurate OTU Clustering with GPU-Based Sequence Alignment and Dynamic Dendrogram Cutting.

De novo clustering is a popular technique to perform taxonomic profiling of a
microbial community by grouping 16S rRNA amplicon reads into operational
taxonomic units (OTUs). In this work, we introduce a new dendrogram-based OTU
clustering pipeline called CRiSPy. The key idea used in CRiSPy to improve
clustering accuracy is the application of an anomaly detection technique to
obtain a dynamic distance cutoff instead of using the de facto value of 97
percent sequence similarity as in most existing OTU clustering pipelines. This
technique works by detecting an abrupt change in the merging heights of a
dendrogram. To produce the output dendrograms, CRiSPy employs the OTU
hierarchical clustering approach that is computed on a genetic distance matrix
derived from an all-against-all read comparison by pairwise sequence alignment.
However, most existing dendrogram-based tools have difficulty processing datasets
larger than 10,000 unique reads due to high computational complexity. We address 
this difficulty by developing two efficient algorithms for CRiSPy: a
compute-efficient GPU-accelerated parallel algorithm for pairwise distance matrix
computation and a memory-efficient hierarchical clustering algorithm. Our
experiments on various datasets with distinct attributes show that CRiSPy is able
to produce more accurate OTU groupings than most OTU clustering applications.
