Effici and Accur OTU Cluster with GPU - Base Sequenc Align and Dynam Dendrogram Cut . De novo cluster is a popular techniqu to perform taxonom profil of a microbi commun by group 16 rRNA amplicon read into oper taxonom unit ( OTU ). In thi work , we introduc a new dendrogram - base OTU cluster pipelin call CRiSPi . The key idea use in CRiSPi to improv cluster accuraci is the applic of an anomali detect techniqu to obtain a dynam distanc cutoff instead of use the de facto valu of 97 percent sequenc similar as in most exist OTU cluster pipelin . Thi techniqu work by detect an abrupt chang in the merg height of a dendrogram . To produc the output dendrogram , CRiSPi employ the OTU hierarch cluster approach that is comput on a genet distanc matrix deriv from an all - against - all read comparison by pairwis sequenc align . Howev , most exist dendrogram - base tool have difficulti process dataset larger than 10 , 000 uniqu read due to high comput complex . We address thi difficulti by develop two effici algorithm for CRiSPi : a comput - effici GPU - acceler parallel algorithm for pairwis distanc matrix comput and a memori - effici hierarch cluster algorithm . Our experi on variou dataset with distinct attribut show that CRiSPi is abl to produc more accur OTU group than most OTU cluster applic .
