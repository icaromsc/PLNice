RNA-Pareto: interactive analysis of Pareto-optimal RNA sequence-structure alignments.

Incorporating secondary structure information into the alignment process improves
the quality of RNA sequence alignments. Instead of using fixed weighting
parameters, sequence and structure components can be treated as different
objectives and optimized simultaneously. The result is not a single, but a
Pareto-set of equally optimal solutions, which all represent different possible
weighting parameters. We now provide the interactive graphical software tool
RNA-Pareto, which allows a direct inspection of all feasible results to the
pairwise RNA sequence-structure alignment problem and greatly facilitates the
exploration of the optimal solution set.
