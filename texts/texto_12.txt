A bit - parallel dynam program algorithm suitabl for DNA sequenc align . Myer ' eleg and power bit - parallel dynam program algorithm for approxim string match ha a restrict that the queri length should be within the word size of the comput , typic 64 . We propos a modif of Myer ' algorithm , in which the modif ha a restrict not on the queri length but on the maximum number of mismatch ( substitut , insert , or delet ), which should be less than half of the word size . The time complex is O ( m log | S |), where m is the queri length and | S | is the size of the alphabet S . Thu , it is particularli suit for sequenc on a small alphabet such as DNA sequenc . In particular , it is use in quickli extend a larg number of seed align against a refer genom for high - throughput short - read data produc by next - gener DNA sequenc .
