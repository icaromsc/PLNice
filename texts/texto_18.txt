Sequence comparison alignment-free approach based on suffix tree and L-words frequency.

The vast majority of methods available for sequence comparison rely on a first
sequence alignment step, which requires a number of assumptions on evolutionary
history and is sometimes very difficult or impossible to perform due to the
abundance of gaps (insertions/deletions). In such cases, an alternative
alignment-free method would prove valuable. Our method starts by a computation of
a generalized suffix tree of all sequences, which is completed in linear time.
Using this tree, the frequency of all possible words with a preset length
L-L-words--in each sequence is rapidly calculated. Based on the L-words frequency
profile of each sequence, a pairwise standard Euclidean distance is then computed
producing a symmetric genetic distance matrix, which can be used to generate a
neighbor joining dendrogram or a multidimensional scaling graph. We present an
improvement to word counting alignment-free approaches for sequence comparison,
by determining a single optimal word length and combining suffix tree structures 
to the word counting tasks. Our approach is, thus, a fast and simple application 
that proved to be efficient and powerful when applied to mitochondrial genomes.
The algorithm was implemented in Python language and is freely available on the
web.
