Sequenc comparison align - free approach base on suffix tree and L - word frequenc . The vast major of method avail for sequenc comparison reli on a first sequenc align step , which requir a number of assumpt on evolutionari histori and is sometim veri difficult or imposs to perform due to the abund of gap ( insert / delet ). In such case , an altern align - free method would prove valuabl . Our method start by a comput of a gener suffix tree of all sequenc , which is complet in linear time . Use thi tree , the frequenc of all possibl word with a preset length L - L - word -- in each sequenc is rapidli calcul . Base on the L - word frequenc profil of each sequenc , a pairwis standard Euclidean distanc is then comput produc a symmetr genet distanc matrix , which can be use to gener a neighbor join dendrogram or a multidimension scale graph . We present an improv to word count align - free approach for sequenc comparison , by determin a singl optim word length and combin suffix tree structur to the word count task . Our approach is , thu , a fast and simpl applic that prove to be effici and power when appli to mitochondri genom . The algorithm wa implement in Python languag and is freeli avail on the web .
