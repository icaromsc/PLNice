A survey of sequence alignment algorithms for next-generation sequencing.

Rapidly evolving sequencing technologies produce data on an unparalleled scale. A
central challenge to the analysis of this data is sequence alignment, whereby
sequence reads must be compared to a reference. A wide variety of alignment
algorithms and software have been subsequently developed over the past two years.
In this article, we will systematically review the current development of these
algorithms and introduce their practical applications on different types of
experimental data. We come to the conclusion that short-read alignment is no
longer the bottleneck of data analyses. We also consider future development of
alignment algorithms with respect to emerging long sequence reads and the
prospect of cloud computing.
