A survey of sequenc align algorithm for next - gener sequenc .
Rapidli evolv sequenc technolog produc data on an unparallel scale .
A central challeng to the analysi of thi data is sequenc align , wherebi sequenc read must be compar to a refer .
A wide varieti of align algorithm and softwar have been subsequ develop over the past two year .
In thi articl , we will systemat review the current develop of these algorithm and introduc their practic applic on differ type of experiment data .
We come to the conclus that short - read align is no longer the bottleneck of data analys .
We also consid futur develop of align algorithm with respect to emerg long sequenc read and the prospect of cloud comput .
