AB : Sequenc align by scan . Sequenc align is an essenti tool in almost ani comput biolog research . It process larg databas sequenc and consid to be high consum of comput time . Heurist algorithm are use to get approxim but fast result . We introduc fast align algorithm , call ' Align By Scan ' ( AB ), to provid an approxim align of two DNA sequenc . We compar our algorithm with the well - known align algorithm , the ' FASTA ' ( which is heurist ) and the ' Needleman - Wunsch ' ( which is optim ). The propos algorithm achiev up to 76 % enhanc in align score when it is compar with the FASTA Algorithm . The evalu are conduct use differ length of DNA sequenc .
