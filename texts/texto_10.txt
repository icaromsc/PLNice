ABS: Sequence alignment by scanning.

Sequence alignment is an essential tool in almost any computational biology
research. It processes large database sequences and considered to be high
consumers of computation time. Heuristic algorithms are used to get approximate
but fast results. We introduce fast alignment algorithm, called 'Alignment By
Scanning' (ABS), to provide an approximate alignment of two DNA sequences. We
compare our algorithm with the well-known alignment algorithms, the 'FASTA'
(which is heuristic) and the 'Needleman-Wunsch' (which is optimal). The proposed 
algorithm achieves up to 76% enhancement in alignment score when it is compared
with the FASTA Algorithm. The evaluations are conducted using different lengths
of DNA sequences.
