Imag correl method for DNA sequenc align . The complex of search and the volum of genom data make sequenc align one of bioinformat most activ research area . New align approach have incorpor digit signal process techniqu . Among these , correl method are highli sensit . Thi paper propos a novel sequenc align method base on 2 - dimension imag , where each nucleic acid base is repres as a fix gray intens pixel . Queri and known databas sequenc are code to their pixel represent and sequenc align is handl as object recognit in a scene problem . Queri and databas becom object and scene , respect . An imag correl process is carri out in order to search for the best match between them . Given that thi procedur can be implement in an optic correl , the correl could eventu be accomplish at light speed . Thi paper show an initi research stage where result were " digit " obtain by simul an optic correl of DNA sequenc repres as imag . A total of 303 queri ( variabl length from 50 to 4500 base pair ) and 100 scene repres by 100 x 100 imag each ( in total , one million base pair databas ) were consid for the imag correl analysi . The result show that correl reach veri high sensit ( 99 . 01 %), specif ( 98 . 99 %) and outperform BLAST when mutat number increas . Howev , digit correl process were hundr time slower than BLAST . We are current start an initi to evalu the correl speed process of a real experiment optic correl . By do thi , we expect to fulli exploit optic correl light properti . As the optic correl work jointli with the comput , digit algorithm should also be optim . The result present in thi paper are encourag and support the studi of imag correl method on sequenc align .
