Fast onlin and index - base algorithm for approxim search of RNA sequenc - structur pattern . BACKGROUND : It is well known that the search for homolog RNA is more effect if both sequenc and structur inform is incorpor into the search . Howev , current tool for search with RNA sequenc - structur pattern cannot fulli handl mutat occur on both these level or are simpli not fast enough for search larg sequenc databas becaus of the high comput cost of the underli sequenc - structur align problem . RESULT : We present new fast index - base and onlin algorithm for approxim match of RNA sequenc - structur pattern support a full set of edit oper on singl base and base pair . Our method effici comput semi - global align of structur RNA pattern and substr of the target sequenc whose cost satisfi a user - defin sequenc - structur edit distanc threshold . For thi purpos , we introduc a new comput scheme to optim reus the entri of the requir dynam program matric for all substr and combin it with a techniqu for avoid the align comput of non - match substr . Our new index - base method exploit suffix array preprocess from the target databas and achiev run time that are sublinear in the size of the search sequenc . To support the descript of RNA molecul that fold into complex secondari structur with multipl order sequenc - structur pattern , we use fast algorithm for the local or global chain of approxim sequenc - structur pattern match . The chain step remov spuriou match from the set of intermedi result , in particular of pattern with littl specif . In benchmark experi on the Rfam databas , our improv onlin algorithm is faster than the best previou method by up to factor 45 . Our best new index - base algorithm achiev a speedup of factor 560 . CONCLUS : The present method achiev consider speedup compar to the best previou method . Thi , togeth with the expect sublinear run time of the present index - base algorithm , allow for the first time approxim match of RNA sequenc - structur pattern in larg sequenc databas . Beyond the algorithm contribut , we provid with RaligN a robust and well document open - sourc softwar packag implement the algorithm present in thi manuscript .
