Nucleotide sequence alignment using sparse coding and belief propagation.

Advances in DNA information extraction techniques have led to huge sequenced
genomes from organisms spanning the tree of life. This increasing amount of
genomic information requires tools for comparison of the nucleotide sequences. In
this paper, we propose a novel nucleotide sequence alignment method based on
sparse coding and belief propagation to compare the similarity of the nucleotide 
sequences. We used the neighbors of each nucleotide as features, and then we
employed sparse coding to find a set of candidate nucleotides. To select optimum 
matches, belief propagation was subsequently applied to these candidate
nucleotides. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is able to
robustly align nucleotide sequences and is competitive to SOAPaligner [1] and BWA
[2].
