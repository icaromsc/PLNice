Nucleotid sequenc align use spars code and belief propag . Advanc in DNA inform extract techniqu have led to huge sequenc genom from organ span the tree of life . Thi increas amount of genom inform requir tool for comparison of the nucleotid sequenc . In thi paper , we propos a novel nucleotid sequenc align method base on spars code and belief propag to compar the similar of the nucleotid sequenc . We use the neighbor of each nucleotid as featur , and then we employ spars code to find a set of candid nucleotid . To select optimum match , belief propag wa subsequ appli to these candid nucleotid . Experiment result show that the propos approach is abl to robustli align nucleotid sequenc and is competit to SOAPalign and BWA .
