Genet algorithm with permut code for multipl sequenc align .
Multipl sequenc align ( MSA ) is one of the topic of bio informat that ha serious been research .
It is known as NP - complet problem .
It is also consid as one of the most import and daunt task in comput biolog .
Concern thi a wide number of heurist algorithm have been propos to find optim align .
Among these heurist algorithm are genet algorithm ( GA ).
The GA ha mainli two major weak : it is time consum and can caus local minima .
One of the signific aspect in the GA process in MSA is to maxim the similar between sequenc by ad and shuffl the gap of Solut Code ( SC ).
Sever way for SC have been introduc . One of them is the Permut Code ( PC ).
We propos a hybrid algorithm base on genet algorithm ( GA ) with a PC and 2 - opt algorithm .
The PC help to code the MSA solut which maxim the gain of resourc , reliabl and divers of GA .
The use of the PC open the area by appli all function over permut for MSA .
Thu , we suggest an algorithm to calcul the score function for multipl align base on PC , which is use as fit function .
The time complex of the GA is reduc by use thi algorithm .
Our GA is implement with differ select strategi and differ crossov .
The probabl of crossov and mutat is set as one strategi .
Relev patent have been probe in the topic .
