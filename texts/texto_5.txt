Genetic algorithms with permutation coding for multiple sequence alignment.

Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is one of the topics of bio informatics that
has seriously been researched. It is known as NP-complete problem. It is also
considered as one of the most important and daunting tasks in computational
biology. Concerning this a wide number of heuristic algorithms have been proposed
to find optimal alignment. Among these heuristic algorithms are genetic
algorithms (GA). The GA has mainly two major weaknesses: it is time consuming and
can cause local minima. One of the significant aspects in the GA process in MSA
is to maximize the similarities between sequences by adding and shuffling the
gaps of Solution Coding (SC). Several ways for SC have been introduced. One of
them is the Permutation Coding (PC). We propose a hybrid algorithm based on
genetic algorithms (GAs) with a PC and 2-opt algorithm. The PC helps to code the 
MSA solution which maximizes the gain of resources, reliability and diversity of 
GA. The use of the PC opens the area by applying all functions over permutations 
for MSA. Thus, we suggest an algorithm to calculate the scoring function for
multiple alignments based on PC, which is used as fitness function. The time
complexity of the GA is reduced by using this algorithm. Our GA is implemented
with different selections strategies and different crossovers. The probability of
crossover and mutation is set as one strategy. Relevant patents have been probed 
in the topic.
