Phylogeni - awar align with PRANK .
Evolutionari analys requir sequenc align that correctli repres evolutionari homolog .
Evolutionari and structur homolog are not the same and sequenc align gener with method design for structur match can be serious mislead in compar and phylogenet analys .
The phylogeni - awar align algorithm implement in the program PRANK ha been shown to produc good align for evolutionari infer .
Unlik other align program , PRANK make use of phylogenet inform to distinguish align gap caus by insert or delet and , thereaft , handl the two type of event differ .
As a by - product of the correct handl of insert and delet , PRANK can provid the infer ancestr sequenc as a part of the output and mark the align gap differ depend on their origin in insert or delet event .
As the algorithm infer the evolutionari histori of the sequenc , PRANK can be sensit to error in the guid phylogeni and violat on the underli assumpt about the origin and pattern of gap .
These issu are discuss in detail and practic advic for the use of PRANK in evolutionari analysi is provid .
