Vertic decomposit with Genet Algorithm for Multipl Sequenc Align .
BACKGROUND : Mani Bioinformat studi begin with a multipl sequenc align as the foundat for their research .
Thi is becaus multipl sequenc align can be a use techniqu for studi molecular evolut and analyz sequenc structur relationship .
RESULT : In thi paper , we have propos a Vertic Decomposit with Genet Algorithm ( VDGA ) for Multipl Sequenc Align ( MSA ).
In VDGA , we divid the sequenc vertic into two or more subsequ , and then solv them individu use a guid tree approach .
Final , we combin all the subsequ to gener a new multipl sequenc align .
Thi techniqu is appli on the solut of the initi gener and of each child gener within VDGA .
We have use two mechan to gener an initi popul in thi research : the first mechan is to gener guid tree with randomli select sequenc and the second is shuffl the sequenc insid such tree .
Two differ genet oper have been implement with VDGA .
To test the perform of our algorithm , we have compar it with exist well - known method , name PRRP , CLUSTALX , DIALIGN , HMMT , SB_PIMA , ML_PIMA , MULTALIGN , and PILEUP8 , and also other method , base on Genet Algorithm ( GA ), such as SAGA , MSA - GA and RBT - GA , by solv a number of benchmark dataset from BAliBas 2 . 0 .
CONCLUS : The experiment result show that the VDGA with three vertic divis wa the most success variant for most of the test case in comparison to other divis consid with VDGA .
The experiment result also confirm that VDGA outperform the other method consid in thi research .
