SeqTool : visual tool for manual analysi of sequenc align .
BACKGROUND : Manual annot is essenti to creat high - qualiti refer align and annot .
Annot need to be abl to view sequenc align in detail .
The SeqTool packag provid three tool for view differ type of sequenc align : Blixem is a mani - to - one browser of pairwis align , display multipl match sequenc align against a singl refer sequenc ;
Dotter provid a graphic dot - plot view of a singl pairwis align ; and Belvu is a multipl sequenc align viewer , editor , and phylogenet tool .
These tool were origin part of the AceDB genom databas system but have been complet rewritten to make them gener avail as a standalon packag of greatli improv function .
FIND : Blixem is use by annot to give a detail view of the evid for particular gene model .
Blixem display the gene model posit and the match sequenc align against the genom refer sequenc .
Annot use thi for mani reason , includ to check the qualiti of an align , to find miss / misalign sequenc and to identifi splice site and polyA site and signal .
Dotter is use to give a dot - plot represent of a particular pairwis align .
Thi is use to identifi sequenc that is not repres ( or is misrepres ) and to quickli compar annot gene model with transcript and protein evid that put support them .
Belvu is use to analys conserv pattern in multipl sequenc align and to perform a combin of manual and automat process of the align .
High - qualiti refer align are essenti if they are to be use as a start point for further automat align gener .
CONCLUS : While there are mani differ align tool avail , the SeqTool packag provid uniqu function that annot have found to be essenti for analys sequenc align as part of the manual annot process .
