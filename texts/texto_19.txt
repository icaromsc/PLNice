Multi - object pairwis RNA sequenc align . MOTIV : With an increas in the number of known biolog function of non - code RNA , the import of RNA sequenc align ha risen . RNA sequenc align problem ha been investig by mani research as a mono - object optim problem where contribut from sequenc similar and secondari structur are taken into account through a singl object function . Sinc there is a trade - off between these two object function , usual we cannot obtain a singl solut that ha both the best sequenc similar score and the best structur score simultan . Multi - object optim is a wide use framework for the optim problem with conflict object function . So far , no one ha examin how good align we can obtain by appli multi - object optim to structur RNA sequenc align problem . RESULT : We develop a pairwis RNA sequenc align program , Cofolga2mo , base on multi - object genet algorithm ( MOGA ). We test Cofolga2mo with a benchmark dataset which includ sequenc pair with a wide rang of sequenc ident , and we obtain at most 100 align for each input RNA sequenc pair as an approxim set of weak Pareto optim solut . We found that the align in the approxim set give benchmark result compar to those obtain by the state - of - the - art mono - object RNA align algorithm . Moreov , we found that our algorithm is effici in both time and memori usag compar to the other method . AVAIL : Our MOGA program for structur RNA sequenc align can be download at http :// rna . eit . hirosaki - u . ac . jp / cofolga2mo /.
