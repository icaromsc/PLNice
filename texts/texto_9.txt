Design of multiple sequence alignment algorithms on parallel, distributed memory supercomputers.

The challenge of comparing two or more genomes that have undergone recombination 
and substantial amounts of segmental loss and gain has recently been addressed
for small numbers of genomes. However, datasets of hundreds of genomes are now
common and their sizes will only increase in the future. Multiple sequence
alignment of hundreds of genomes remains an intractable problem due to quadratic 
increases in compute time and memory footprint. To date, most alignment
algorithms are designed for commodity clusters without parallelism. Hence, we
propose the design of a multiple sequence alignment algorithm on massively
parallel, distributed memory supercomputers to enable research into comparative
genomics on large data sets. Following the methodology of the sequential
progressiveMauve algorithm, we design data structures including sequences and
sorted k-mer lists on the IBM Blue Gene/P supercomputer (BG/P). Preliminary
results show that we can reduce the memory footprint so that we can potentially
align over 250 bacterial genomes on a single BG/P compute node. We verify our
results on a dataset of E.coli, Shigella and S.pneumoniae genomes. Our
implementation returns results matching those of the original algorithm but in
1/2 the time and with 1/4 the memory footprint for scaffold building. In this
study, we have laid the basis for multiple sequence alignment of large-scale
datasets on a massively parallel, distributed memory supercomputer, thus enabling
comparison of hundreds instead of a few genome sequences within reasonable time.
