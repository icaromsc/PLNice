Design of multipl sequenc align algorithm on parallel , distribut memori supercomput . The challeng of compar two or more genom that have undergon recombin and substanti amount of segment loss and gain ha recent been address for small number of genom . Howev , dataset of hundr of genom are now common and their size will onli increas in the futur . Multipl sequenc align of hundr of genom remain an intract problem due to quadrat increas in comput time and memori footprint . To date , most align algorithm are design for commod cluster without parallel . Henc , we propos the design of a multipl sequenc align algorithm on massiv parallel , distribut memori supercomput to enabl research into compar genom on larg data set . Follow the methodolog of the sequenti progressiveMauv algorithm , we design data structur includ sequenc and sort k - mer list on the IBM Blue Gene / P supercomput ( BG / P ). Preliminari result show that we can reduc the memori footprint so that we can potenti align over 250 bacteri genom on a singl BG / P comput node . We verifi our result on a dataset of E . coli , Shigella and S . pneumonia genom . Our implement return result match those of the origin algorithm but in 1 / 2 the time and with 1 / 4 the memori footprint for scaffold build . In thi studi , we have laid the basi for multipl sequenc align of larg - scale dataset on a massiv parallel , distribut memori supercomput , thu enabl comparison of hundr instead of a few genom sequenc within reason time .
